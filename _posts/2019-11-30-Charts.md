**What did you work on today?**  
I worked on adding a pie chart to Salmon Cookies showing daily cookie sales by store and a bar chart showing cookie sales by hour for all stores.

**What do you plan on working tomorrow?**  
I want to loop back to the jquery for the table to figure out why it's appending additional information each time. I also plan to refactor the site to be mobile-first with media queries.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
It was good to revisit chart.js to remember how to use helper functions to get arrays of the labels and data you want for the chart itself.
