**What did you work on today?**  
I began the 401 prework, including confirming and updating my bash configuration, updating git, installed nvm, and installed MongoDB.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue working through the 401 prework.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I am having an issue at the moment with starting up my mongo server (it's saying the path doesn't exist and I've confirmed it does and tried variations), so I am in the process of troubleshooting that issue :).
