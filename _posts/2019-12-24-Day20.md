**What did you work on today?**  
I completed the second half of the ES6 freeCodeCamp tutorial and also completed the freeCodeCamp Debugging tutorial.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to complete the freeCodeCamp Functional Programming tutorial on Thursday.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
Today was a good review of template literals, object literals, classes, modules, promises, and debugging. It was helpful to see how ES6 allows for drier, more concise code. I am little confused about the class vs. constructor function (it doesn't really appear to be shorter/save space). If I'm understanding correctly, it looks like the class syntax simply replaces the constructor function syntax, but I am going to look into this further. I also want to understand the concept of a private variable better by finding some examples/use-cases of why this is needed.
