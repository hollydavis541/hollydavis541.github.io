**What did you work on today?**  
I reviewed the requirements and website for this week's design project and initiated a discussion with my team on Slack about how to approach it. I also began working through the JavaScript tutorial on Codecademy as a refresher, revisiting concepts and practicing them. I have an interview tomorrow, so I plan to spend the rest of my evening doing more preparation for that.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan on working on the group design challenge project, adding content and styling to match the site.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I played around with conditionals, ternaries, and switch statements through some mini-projects in Codecademy.
