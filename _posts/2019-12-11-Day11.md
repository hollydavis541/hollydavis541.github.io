**What did you work on today?**  
I linked the Google Fonts and Font Awesome to all pages and and created the HTML structure for the recent posts sidebar. I updated the the header and "breadcrumb" styling and the social media icon styling with hover states. I also added a desktop media query in preparation for hiding the navigation menu and adding a hamburger menu instead to the mobile view.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue to style the main section of the travel page.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
It has been interesting to look at the source code of the original site we are modeling the redesign after. Some parts of it are confusing, so it's good practice to orient myself to someone else's code and then pull out information that helps me recreate a component.
