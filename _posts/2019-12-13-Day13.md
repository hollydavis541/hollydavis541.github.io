**What did you work on today?**  
I updated the portfolio section of my portfolio site, added the Pocket Gallery project and added a placeholder for project descriptions.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
This weekend I plan to add project descriptions including the languages used to my portfolio. I also plan to check in with my project team and do so more styling refinements on the jacket website.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I didn't learn anything really in-depth today, just additional practice in HTML and CSS which is always good.
