**What did you work on today?**  
I created modules for each API and required them in server.js, created the schema, and created save functions for each API which are all working correctly at the moment except for trails which I will troubleshoot tomorrow.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to set up a "lookup" function to check if information already in the database and also add the cache invalidation checks.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I reinforced how to create modules and also how to work with related tables in a database.
