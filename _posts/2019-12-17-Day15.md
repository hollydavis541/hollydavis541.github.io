**What did you work on today?**  
I completed the four REPL challenges, installed HTTPie, updated my Postman app, created/confirmed the online accounts needed for Code 401, and bookmarked the books/resources needed for Code 401.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to do the Deployment Workshop and do some planning for the coming weeks (look at what assignments are coming up, decide on my game plan for completing them, and also take stock of what coding reading and practice I want to do on my own).

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
The REPL challenges were a good brain warmup because at first I was confused by what I was looking at (I read the errors, but was still confused about the structure of the tests and what exactly I needed to do). I mentioned this to my peers on Slack and Travis suggested to start with a challenge other than Promises. I started with the Arrow Functions challenge and was able to understand what I was reading and then work my way back to Promises once I understood the flow.
