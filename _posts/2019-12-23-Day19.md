**What did you work on today?**  
I did the typing for coders lessons and half of the freeCodeCamp ES6 lessons (the lessons relating to object mutation, arrow functions, and destructuring objects and arrays).

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue working through the freeCodeCamp lessons.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I learned some new things about ES6, including...
- that you can set default parameters for functions so that if an argument isn't given when called it will use that default
- that a rest `...` parameter allows for a varying number of arguments
- that spread syntax pulls out the comma-separated values from an array so that this list can be used as arguments in the function being called
