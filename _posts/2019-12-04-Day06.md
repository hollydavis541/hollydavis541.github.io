**What did you work on today?**  
I set up the routes and functions for all of the APIs as well as the error handler function. The correct information is showing on the front end when I search by location. I also deployed the back-end to Heroku and confirmed functionality.

**What do you plan on working tomorrow?**  
I plan to set up the database schema and functions for saving and checking for information in the database, as well as incorporating the cache invalidation testing I previously played around with earlier this week.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I reinforced the setup of constructors, callback functions, reviewing API documentation, and reviewing what the API returns based on varying search parameters. I am still struggling to understand the correct way/best practice for setting up error handlers (how they should be structured). I read some [documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html) on this today and plan to look into this more. For instance, I can see that the front end has a "responseText" template for the error to show up in a paragraph, but I'm having trouble getting that to show up correctly. I know it needs to be in an object in my error handler, but was having trouble with it, so I reverted my error handler to what I had in place previously for now (currently it at least shows the 500 error as expected in the Network tab and in the console, but that's not informative to the site visitor).
