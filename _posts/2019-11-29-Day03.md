**What did you work on today?**  
I worked on refactoring my Salmon Cookies to use jQuery. I'm almost done, but have one quirk I'm trying to figure out where the data is appending itself too many times.

**What do you plan on working tomorrow?**  
I plan on working on adding Chart.js to Salmon Cookies.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
It was good to look through the js code for Salmon Cookies again to recall what it was doing in rendering the table and what happens when a new city is added via the form. I got more practice using jQuery and it is cool to see how many lines of code you save (it's more intuitive).
