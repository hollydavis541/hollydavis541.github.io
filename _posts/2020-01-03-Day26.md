**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to finish the Python assignment by writing up the comparisons/differences between syntax. I also plan to review the readings and any final pre-work steps needed before Monday.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I learned the basics of setting up a Python server, including how to create routes that reference html templates, how to import files into the main server.py file, and what the general request/response structure looks like in Python.
