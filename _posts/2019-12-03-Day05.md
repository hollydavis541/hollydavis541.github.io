**What did you work on today?**  
I started the rebuild of City Explorer, including setting up the initial file structure, package dependencies, Location constructor, location route, and associated callback function to retrieve information from the Google API.

**What do you plan on working tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue the rebuild of City Explorer, adding routes and callbacks to get information for each API. Once I have all of the API callbacks working correctly, I will then work on setting up the database, tables, routes and callbacks needed for caching information.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I re-enforced the initial setup steps for a server and gained additional practice creating a constructor that maps to the information being returned from an API, and creating a callback that uses superagent to retrieve information from an API.
