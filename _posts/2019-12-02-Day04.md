**What did you work on today?**  
I went through the Node.js tutorial in Codecademy and then reviewed the code in my City Explorer project in preparation for rebuilding it this week. I researched the [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and played around with finding the difference between dates in REPL in preparation for figuring out how to retrieve new information from the City Explorer APIs if the requested information in the tables is stale.

**What do you plan on working tomorrow?**  
I plan on starting the rebuild of the City Explorer back-end from scratch, getting the initial file structure, server.js, and database with tables set up.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I reviewed various components of Node.js to help further solidify the various pieces that are needed or available for use (e.g. various built-in modules or ones you can create yourself for easier-to-read code).
