**What did you work on today?**  
I continued watching videos and taking quizzes in the Udemy data structures and algorithms course. 

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue going through the Udemy course as I travel tomorrow.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I took a few quizzes on Big O Notation which was a good review of what I watched on Udemy a few days ago, specifically to understand when the time complexity should be described as O(1) vs. 0(n) vs. 0(n^2).
