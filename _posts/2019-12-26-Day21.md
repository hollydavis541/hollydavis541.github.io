**What did you work on today?**  
I completed the freeCodeCamp Functional Programming tutorial.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan on continuing the Udemy data structures and algorithms course.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
This was a good review of some of the concepts we also practiced in our daily challenges from 301. It also helps to have a review of the best practices for functional programming along with examples that show why it's important to avoid mutation of variables as much as possible.
