**What did you work on today?**  
I worked on reviewing jQuery via various online resources including [Codecademy's course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery) that incorporates coding practice throughout the tutorial with an embedded editor.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan on diving into refactoring my Salmon Cookies project to use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
We used jQuery early in Code 301, but then I didn't use it much after that, so today was a good refresher in order to remind myself of some of the methods available and see different examples of jQuery in action. The Codecademy course immediately walks you through practical examples such as using jQuery to make a dropdown menu appear when clicked and disappear when the mouse leaves the menu area.
