**What did you work on today?**  
I watched the [lab deployment tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8tQd4akmb8&feature=youtu.be) and went through the steps to set up a repository and go through the process shown in the video (connecting to Travis and Heroku).

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I'm leaning toward redoing some of the code challenges and stretch goal challenges from 301. 

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
The deployment workshop was really helpful. I appreciate having this walkthrough prior to the course starting so that the workflow isn't brand new to us on day one. It's a little time-consuming the first time through, but I am sure that after doing this a few more times it will go quickly.
