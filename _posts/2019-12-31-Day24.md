**What did you work on today?**  
I watched the Jest Crash Course video and started the tutorial.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to complete the Jest Crash Course tutorial. 

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I learned the basics of how to set up jest tests, including exporting functions into the testing js file, setting up the package.json to use jest and jest watchAll, and using expect.assertions(#) for asynchronous functions.
