**What did you work on today?**  
I figured out the issue I was having saving information to my trails table. I also added a location lookup from the database function, including the age of the data, and the function that either gets from the API or the database based on the lookup and age of data.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to add lookups to the other APIs and figure out how deletion will work across tables if the data is outdated.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I gained further understanding about request/response parameters and how the information requested passes through to the related location functions.
