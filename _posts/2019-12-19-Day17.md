**What did you work on today?**  
I reviewed and submitted several of the prework assignments for 401 in Canvas. I also spent some time setting up AWS:
1. Followed the [bundled installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html) to install AWS CLI version 1  
2. [Created an Administrator IAM User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) via the console (steps 1-15)  
3. Followed the "quick configuration" steps outlined [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration) and created the default profile using the `aws configure` command  
  
When I execute `aws --version`, I get the following output: `aws-cli/1.16.307 Python/2.7.16 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/1.13.43`. However, when I execute the `aws s3 ls` command, I'm not getting any output. I researched this issue, but haven't figured out the problem yet.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
Tomorrow is a heavy travel day for me, so I have some coding and tutorial apps on my phone that I plan to play around with and/or do some reading.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I gained initial exposure to AWS while going through their setup instructions.
