***Hello DevStation!***

**Did you have any issues creating a blog?**
Yes, I was trying to follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and was having issues installing Jekyll because of some gem permission restrictions that I couldn't get around even using sudo. I will loop back to researching this further when I have time. Ultimately, I found [this post](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and simply created the &ldquo;_posts&rdquo; folder and an index.html file with a template that mirrors the one in their example. Once I did this, my first post appeared correctly on my site&rsquo;s [home page](https://hollydavis541.github.io/).

**How will you spend Thanksgiving this week?**
I'm not sure yet. I may meet up with a friend for an early morning hike and then noms.
