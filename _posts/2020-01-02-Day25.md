**What did you work on today?**  
I finished the Jest Crash Course and started reading through the Python material.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to complete the Python tutorial.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I learned another useful tool is to add "-- coverage" to the jest test line in package.json which will then monitor the statements in your js file and flag if any of them aren't being tested. To see the report of any statements not being tested, run the `npm test -- --coverage` command.
