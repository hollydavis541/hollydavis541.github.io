**What did you work on today?**  
I completed the bulk of the styling for the travel page, including the various list components throughout the page, the comment form, and the recent posts/search sidebar. I then changed the page's styling for the desktop media query.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to work on making some updates to my portfolio, but it will be a lighter work day for me tomorrow because I'm driving to Mt. Hood for the weekend (I will do some additional work over the weekend once I'm there). 

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I gained practice with flexbox in order to get the recent posts/search section to show alongside the article when in desktop view.
