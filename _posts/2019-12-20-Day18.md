**What did you work on today?**  
I started Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass on Udemy.

**What do you plan on working on tomorrow?**  
I plan to continue with the Udemy course and may start on re-doing some of the 301 code challenges in REPL for practice.

**Reflection: What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?**  
I got an introduction to Big O notation, counting operations, and running timers/graphing how long it takes for certain functions to run. Colt explained the Big O concepts of O(1) when the amount of operations remains the same and O(n) when the amount of operations is connected to a multiple of n (e.g. in the case of a loop).
